* Aim: organizing data in memory, as the name indicates itself
* Ways of organizing data:
  * [Array](/Computer%20Science/Array.md)
  * [Stack](/Computer%20Science/Stack.md)
  * [Tree](/Computer%20Science/Tree.md)
  * [Linked List](/Computer%20Science/Linked%20List.md)
  * [Queue](/Computer%20Science/Queue.md)
  * [Hash Table](/Computer%20Science/Hash%20Table.md)
  * [Graph](/Computer%20Science/Graph.md)
  * [Heap](/Computer%20Science/Heap.md)
* Those are algorithms that can be used in any programming language
* Types of Data Structures
  * primitive data structure
    * can hold a single value e.g. [int](/int.md), [char](/char.md), [float](/float.md), [double](/double.md), [pointer](/pointer.md)
  * non-primitive data structure
    * linear data structure
      * arrangement of data in sequential manner e.g. [Array](/Computer%20Science/Array.md), [Linked List](/Computer%20Science/Linked%20List.md), [Stack](/Computer%20Science/Stack.md), [Queue](/Computer%20Science/Queue.md)
      * one element is connected to only **one** another element in a linear form
    * non-linear data structure
      * one element is connected to **'n' number** of elements e.g. [Tree](/Computer%20Science/Tree.md), [Graph](/Computer%20Science/Graph.md)
      * elements are arranged in random manner
* Classifications of Data Structures
  * static data structure
    * size is allocated at compile time - therefore, the maximum size is fixed
  * dynamic data structure
    * size is allocated at run time - therefore, the maximum size is flexible
* Major (common) Operations
  * Searching
    * search for any element
  * Sorting
    * sort elements in ascending or descending order
  * Insertion
    * insert new element
  * Updation
    * update the element, i.e. replace the element with another element
  * Deletion
    * remove elements
* [ADT (Abstract data type)](/Computer%20Science/Abstract%20data%20type.md)
  * ADT tells **what** is to be done and data structure tell **how** it is to be done
