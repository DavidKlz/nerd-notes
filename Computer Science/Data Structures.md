* Aim: organizing data in memory, as the name indicates itself
* Ways of organizing data:
	* [[Array]]
	* [[Stack]]
	* [[Tree]]
	* [[Linked List]]
	* [[Queue]]
	* [[Hash Table]]
	* [[Graph]]
	* [[Heap]]
* Those are algorithms that can be used in any programming language
* Types of Data Structures
	* primitive data structure
		* can hold a single value e.g. [[int]], [[char]], [[float]], [[double]], [[pointer]]
	* non-primitive data structure
		* linear data structure
			* arrangement of data in sequential manner e.g. [[Array]], [[Linked List]], [[Stack]], [[Queue]]
			* one element is connected to only **one** another element in a linear form
		* non-linear data structure
			* one element is connected to **'n' number** of elements e.g. [[Tree]], [[Graph]]
			* elements are arranged in random manner
* Classifications of Data Structures
	* static data structure
		* size is allocated at compile time - therefore, the maximum size is fixed
	* dynamic data structure
		* size is allocated at run time - therefore, the maximum size is flexible
* Major (common) Operations
	* Searching
		* search for any element
	* Sorting
		* sort elements in ascending or descending order
	* Insertion
		* insert new element
	* Updation
		* update the element, i.e. replace the element with another element
	* Deletion
		* remove elements
* [[Abstract data type|ADT (Abstract data type)]]
	* ADT tells **what** is to be done and data structure tell **how** it is to be done
